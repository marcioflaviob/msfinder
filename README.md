# Recommend me a movie based on a song!

## A website that recommends a movie based on a chosen song. 

### Successfully integrated three APIs, including OpenAI's API to use artificial intelligence to find a movie that is similar to the chosen song.


## About it

This project was really helpful to understand APIs and learn how to overcome challenges related to API inconsistencies and data complexities.

This was my first full-stack project, seamlessly integrating front and back-end components. Overcame several challenges, particularly on the front-end, an area I consider my web development growth edge
